// My Bestfriend Essay:

I first met Gurseerat in fourth class! At first I thought she was rude but then after meeting 
her and talking to her made me realise she is so kind and sweet... She was the first ever Transfer 
student in our class this thing also made me think that i will never be such good friends with her 
but destinies have some other plans ... This friendship is about of 11years now still we talk like
old times even if we are in long distance friendship .. she understands me so well that i just need
her sometimes ... At last i wanna say have a true /real bestie in your life is a wholesome blessing!
